Task Overview**\n\nCryptocurrency markets operate continuously without circuit breakers or overnight closures.\nThis 24/7 environment, together with rapidly changing liquidity conditions, leads to pronounced\nshort-horizon volatility and shifting dependence structures across assets. Reliable intraday\nforecasting is therefore both challenging and practically important for risk monitoring, hedging,\nand algorithmic decision-making.\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to forecast multivariate intraday log-return trajectories\nfor a small set of highly liquid cryptocurrencies. Participants must predict the near-future evolution\nof hourly log-returns, capturing volatility dynamics and cross-asset relationships under relatively\nstable macroeconomic conditions.\n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants are required to build and train a forecasting model that predicts the next 4 hourly\nlog-return steps for three major cryptocurrencies, conditioned on the preceding 20 hours of observed\nlog-returns.\n\nEach data sample represents one 24-hour window of hourly log-returns observed simultaneously across\nthe three assets. For forecasting, each 24-hour trajectory is split into an input context window\nconsisting of the first 20 hourly time steps, and a prediction target horizon consisting of the\nfinal 4 hourly time steps.\n\nModels should learn short-horizon temporal patterns (e.g., volatility clustering), handle noisy\nreturn dynamics, and preserve cross-asset dependence in the forecast horizon. Any forecasting\napproach may be used, including classical time-series models, machine learning methods, deep\nlearning sequence models, or hybrid approaches, provided that the outputs conform exactly to\nthe required format.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset consists of historical hourly log-return data for three of the most actively traded\ncryptocurrencies, spanning multiple years. To reduce the impact of extreme market regimes, periods\nassociated with the COVID-19 crisis and large-scale quantitative easing have been excluded.\nThe time series are segmented into overlapping 24-hour samples using a rolling window approach.\n\nFor the forecasting task, participants are provided with the following pre-split NumPy datasets:\nTraining inputs: train_X.npy, shape [7150, 20, 3]\nTraining targets: train_Y.npy, shape [7150, 4, 3]\nTest inputs: test_X.npy, shape [1787, 20, 3]\n\nA held-out test target set (corresponding to the final 4 hours) is used for evaluation and is not\nprovided to participants. Final ranking is based solely on performance on this held-out test set\nusing all evaluation metrics.\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nForecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:\n\n- RMSE: Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.\n- MAE: Mean absolute error providing a stable magnitude-based measure.\n- MAPE: Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison.\n\nEvaluation code for all metrics will be provided.\n\n**5.

Task Overview**\n\nFinancial time series are characterised by non-stationarity, heavy tails, and complex\ncross-asset interactions.

Task Overview**\n\nThe limited availability of financial and economic data is a major bottleneck for the effective\napplication of machine learning methods in finance. Forecasting models trained on financial time\nseries must handle strong non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and abrupt structural\nchanges that often reflect regime shifts such as periods of market stress.\n\nAccurate short- to medium-horizon forecasting of multivariate price\u2013volatility dynamics is\nimportant for risk management, scenario analysis, and trading. In regime-switching environments,\nmodels must remain robust under both stable and elevated-volatility episodes and should preserve\ncross-asset relationships rather than fitting only marginal trends.\n\nThis task focuses on forecasting the near-future evolution of a multivariate financial system by\nlearning from historical trajectories that implicitly contain multiple market regimes.\n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nIn this competition, participants are challenged to construct a forecasting model that predicts\nthe next two time steps of a multivariate financial time series given the preceding history.\n\nEach sample trajectory represents the joint evolution of price and volatility processes for two\nfinancial instruments over 20 time steps. For the forecasting task, each trajectory is split into:\n\n- an input context window of the first 18 time steps, and\n- a prediction target horizon of the final 2 time steps.\n\nModels are expected to learn medium-horizon temporal structure, handle regime-dependent dynamics\n(without explicit regime labels), and preserve cross-variable and cross-asset dependence in their\nforecasts. Any forecasting approach may be used, including classical time-series models, machine\nlearning regressors, deep learning sequence models, or hybrid methods, provided that outputs conform\nto the required format.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nParticipants will be provided with pre-split NumPy datasets derived from the original regime-switching\ntrajectories. The original data consist of multivariate sample paths with shape [N, 20, 4], where each\ntrajectory contains 20 time steps, and 4 channels corresponding to price and volatility variables for\ntwo financial instruments.\n\nFor this forecasting task, the following the data are split into input\u2013target pairs as follows:\n- Training inputs: train_X.npy with shape [20000, 18, 4]\n  The first 18 time steps of each training trajectory.\n\n- Training targets: train_Y.npy with shape [20000, 2, 4]\n  The final 2 time steps to be forecasted.\n- Test inputs: test_X.npy with shape [2000, 18, 4]\n  The first 18 time steps of each test trajectory.\n\nA held-out test target set (corresponding to the final 2 time steps) is used for evaluation and is not\nprovided to participants.

Submission**\n\nParticipants must return its forecasts as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists),\nrepresenting the prediction array. The file must contain model forecasts corresponding to\nthe test inputs and must have the shape [2000, 2, 4].\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on the 2-day forecast horizon.\n- Produce stable forecasts without systematic drift or excessive noise.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nAlthough the forecast horizon is short, the underlying trajectories exhibit regime-switching behaviour\nand heterogeneous volatility patterns. Successful models must generalise across both stable and stressed\nregimes and preserve multivariate dependence structures, making the task substantially more challenging\nthan standard stationary forecasting benchmarks.\n",
