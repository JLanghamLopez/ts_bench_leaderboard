Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to generate multivariate intraday log-return trajectories over a 24-hour horizon\nfor a small set of highly liquid cryptocurrencies. The objective is to model short-horizon return behaviour observed\nin continuous cryptocurrency markets, including volatility dynamics and cross-asset dependence, under relatively stable\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants are required to train a generative model that produces intraday log-return trajectories for three highly\ntraded cryptocurrencies. Each data sample represents one trading day and consists of 24 consecutive hourly log-returns\nobserved simultaneously across the three assets.\n\nThe training data are constructed using a rolling window approach applied to historical market data. Each window is\ntreated as an independent sample drawn from an unknown underlying distribution of daily return trajectories.\nThe modelling objective is to learn this distribution and to generate new synthetic samples that are indistinguishable\nfrom real data in terms of their statistical and temporal properties.\n\nAny generative modelling approach may be used, including diffusion-based models, GANs, flow-based models, autoregressive\ngenerators, or other sequence-based methods. Regardless of the modelling choice, generated outputs must have the exact\nshape [24,3] and reflect realistic intraday behaviour, including variability over time and dependence between assets.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset consists of historical hourly log-return data for three of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies,\nspanning more than seven years. To reduce the impact of extreme market regimes, periods associated with the COVID-19\ncrisis and large-scale quantitative easing have been excluded. The time series are segmented into overlapping 24-hour\nsamples using a rolling window approach.\n\nOnly the training dataset (train_log_return.npy) will be provided to participants, which has shape (7150, 24, 3).\nFinal evaluation is performed on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nGenerated trajectories are evaluated by comparison with real test trajectories using the following metrics:\n\n- HistogramMetric: Measures the similarity between real and generated time series by comparing their empirical marginal distributions.\n- CrossCorrelationMetric:  Evaluates whether dependence structures across different dimensions of the time series are preserved.\n- AutoCorrelationMetric:  Assesses temporal dependence within individual time series components.\n\nEvaluation code for all metrics will be provided.\n\n**5. Submission**\n\nParticipants must return 1787 generated multivariate time series samples as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists) with shape [1787, 24, 3].\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.\n- Preserve cross-asset dependence as measured by CrossCorrelationMetric.\n- Match short-horizon temporal behaviour reflected by AutoCorrelationMetric.\n- Produce stable trajectories without obvious artefacts.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nThe task focuses on modelling short-horizon multivariate return dynamics for a small number of assets under\nrelatively stable market conditions. While temporal and cross-sectional dependence must be captured, the\nreduced dimensionality and absence of regime extremes make the problem more accessible than large-scale,\nhigh-dimensional financial generative modelling tasks.\n",

Task Overview**\n\nFinancial time series often exhibit non-stationarity, heavy tails, and complex temporal dependence,\nmaking realistic data-driven modelling a challenging task. In many practical applications, the availability\nof high-quality financial data is limited, which restricts the performance of downstream machine learning models.\nSynthetic data generation offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of artificial time series that\npreserve the statistical characteristics of real data while mitigating data scarcity and privacy concerns.\nThis task focuses on the unconditional generation of financial time series under regular market conditions.\nParticipants are asked to develop generative models that can produce realistic multivariate financial time series\nreflecting normal market dynamics, without conditioning on explicit regime labels.\n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nIn this competition, participants are challenged to construct and train an unconditional generative model capable of\nsimulating synthetic financial time series that closely approximate the distribution of real data observed under\nnormal market conditions.\n\nEach generated sample should represent the joint evolution of daily returns and volatility for multiple financial assets\nover a short time horizon. The objective is to reproduce realistic temporal dynamics and cross-asset relationships present\nin the training data.\n\nAny generative modelling approach may be used, including GANs, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, or other\nsequence-based generators, provided that the generated outputs match the required data format.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset consists of historical financial time series representing daily return and volatility dynamics under normal\nmarket conditions.

Task Overview**\n\nThe limited availability of financial and economic data is a major bottleneck for the effective application of\nmachine learning methods in finance. High-fidelity synthetic data generation provides a promising approach to\naugment existing datasets while preserving statistical properties and protecting data privacy. Recent advances\nin generative modelling, including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion-based models, have shown strong potential in this area.\n\nFinancial time series exhibit distinctive challenges, such as strong time heterogeneity, low signal-to-noise ratios,\nand abrupt structural changes. In particular, asset price and volatility dynamics often behave very differently\nduring periods of market stress compared to economically stable regimes. These regime shifts are commonly associated\nwith events such as financial crises, pandemics, or major policy interventions.\n\nThis task focuses on developing generative models that can faithfully reproduce multivariate financial time series\nexhibiting regime-switching behaviour. Robust solutions are expected to capture both normal and high-volatility\nregimes and the transitions between them.\n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nIn this competition, participants are challenged to construct a generative model capable of producing synthetic\nfinancial time series that closely mimic the joint distribution of price and volatility processes for multiple\nfinancial instruments.\n\nThe training data consist of short multivariate trajectories that reflect different market regimes, including\nlow-volatility and high-volatility episodes. These regimes are not explicitly labelled; instead, regime characteristics\nmust be inferred implicitly from the observed dynamics. Participants may employ any generative modelling approach,\nincluding but not limited to GAN-based models, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, or other sequence-based\ngenerators. Generated samples should reproduce realistic temporal dynamics, cross-variable relationships, and\nregime-dependent behaviour observed in the real data.\n\n**3.

No explicit regime labels are provided.\n\nFinal ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nModels will be evaluated by comparing generated trajectories to real test trajectories using three metrics:\n\n- HistogramMetric: Measures the similarity between real and generated time series by comparing their empirical marginal distributions.\n- CrossCorrelationMetric: Evaluates whether dependence structures across different dimensions of the time series are preserved.\n- AutoCorrelationMetric: Assesses temporal dependence within individual time series components.\n\nEvaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.\n\n**5.
